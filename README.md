For Predicting the time and impact of earthquakes

We want to introduce AI into the picture for predicting natural disasters.
Pattern recognition cannot be used here because in past they haven’t worked out so well and there is no definite pattern to predict earthquakes. So we have come up with a solution.
You might think Earth is a giant lump of rock, but you'd be wrong—it's more like a freshly boiled egg: there's a hot, molten core bubbling away inside a surprisingly thin outer crust. The countries we live in feel like they're safely anchored on solid rocky foundations, but really they're fixed to enormous rocky slabs called tectonic plates that can slide around on the molten rock beneath. Imagine living your life on an eggshell!
Earthquakes happen at places called faults (or fault lines) where the jagged edges of two tectonic plates grind against one another. Most earthquake activity happens in the middles of the oceans where plates are pushing apart on the floor of the sea.
Eg Ring of fire in Pacific Ocean.
Currently we have advanced ground detection systems but we need some work on ocean detection systems, sensors underneath ocean to predict the weight of the water which can help us with earthquakes as well as in predicting the direction of possible tsunamis.
# Big issue: Tectonic plates move very slowly and hence it is difficult to predict when they are going collide and produce an energy wave in the form of an earthquake. Also, it is hard to predict the impact of aftershocks that can go on for a few hours/days.
# Solution:
# So, firstly we need really high measurement devices or sensors that are going to detect even the slightest change in the distance between tectonic plates, then previous earthquakes statistics can provide us with the distance, speed, friction between plates and various other parameters between tectonic plates. Then based on those statistics we can train an AI model which will give us a prediction of impact and time of the collision of tectonic plates. 
Also, this AI model will be region-specific for better precision and time efficiency.
Also, we need satellites to have the same algorithm for predicting earthquakes and their impact.
Based on this concept, an app can be created which will track your location and provide you with live probability of the earthquake in your area and will alert you before time if there are any chances of them in your area.
So, we basically want to use AI algorithm not only in the sensors but in satellites as well. 
As for ocean- detection system, the main parameter will be weight of the water, based on that we will use our algorithm to predict the chances of an earthquake and also a possible tsunami.
Scientists will be able to spot electromagnetic signals with one satellite and then, when the second one shows up, use it to triangulate where the signals are coming from. That would help rule out non-earthquake sources.
